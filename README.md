# Seven-Segment-Api-For-LPC802
 A seven segment API built to easily integrate with the LPC 802 board

The 4 files included offer access to the library as well as an example code to demonstrate setup.

The code will internally setup the use of clocks, and pin assignments once the pin data is sent in. Note that the interrupt calls need to be implmented by the user, allowing you to add in additional logic if needed. 

This code can be freely used "as-is" without warrainties or conditions of any kinds. I take no liability for damages incurred by using this software. No contributors to this software are  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
